A personal portfolio is a collection of your work, skills, accomplishments, and experiences, presented in a clear and organized manner. It can take many forms, including a website, physical or digital folder, or a presentation, and is a powerful tool for showcasing your abilities to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.
